            How I got Interested in Software Development
        </h5>
        <img src = "./img/background-photo.jpeg"/>
        <p>
            I got involved with software development very early. I had a computer science class in middle school where we 
            made a very rough and back software but thats where I got introduced to coding and software development. Another huge 
            inspiration was my uncle who is a software programer and watching him work was very inspiring. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am mostly intreasted in coding and programing rather than development but they sometimes go hand in hand. As I moved
            into highschool I was given the chance to finally take an actual computer science course which fullfilled my desire by
            actually letting me code and create things with computers. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            I've played video games all my life so to be a video game programmer or something to do with video games would be amazing.
            I plan to follow computer science into college and beyond which may lead me to other jobs but I hope I can spend some time
            playing and creating video games. I also have studied Japanese for 4 years and want to pursue it futher beyond high school.
            I believe Japanese to be a facinating language. As of right now I can spell and read the language quite well although speaking is definitly harder.
